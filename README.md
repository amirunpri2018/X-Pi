## Sign up for the hackathon
Sign up for the hackathon here: https://pytorch.devpost.com/


## Main Requirement
Build a creative and well-implemented solution using PyTorch that can create a positive impact on businesses or people. The solution can be a machine learning model, an application, or a creative project such as art or music built with PyTorch.

All solutions along with the required assets below must be submitted by 5:00PM EDT on September 16.

## We need to submit
Submit the following assets: 
1. Demo video. (hosted on YouTube, Facebook Video, Vimeo, or Youku). Your video should be around 1-3 minutes (can be a little longer if needed), include a demo of your working application via a step-by-step visual demo, and be available in English. Be sure to explain how PyTorch was used to build your application!
2. Images. Please submit at least one image/screenshot of your application.
3. Access. Provide a link to your publicly accessible code repository on GitHub or Bitbucket.

## Dataset
CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and competition for automated chest x-ray interpretation, which features uncertainty labels and radiologist-labeled reference standard evaluation sets. 
CheXpert is a large public dataset for chest radiograph interpretation, consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients.
